  Outputs are the targets where to store the artifacts generated by some actionners
---

Some `actionners` allow or require an `output` section. 
The `output` is the target where to store the resulting artifact that might has been created by the `actionner`. 

For example:
 - the `actionner` `kubernetes:log` just allows to set an `output` to store the collected logs, if nothing is set, then they are printed in the stdout inside the log line
 - the `kubernetes:download` requires an output to store the downloaded file from the pod.

The targets used by the `Outputs` as storage are named with the pattern `category:service`.

The `category` allows to group `outputs` in use and avoid multiple initializations (eg, multi Kubernetes API client, multi AWS clients, ...).

The clients/sessions used by some `actionners` and some `outputs` are the same, eg: `aws:lambda` (`actionner`) and `aws:s3` (`output`). This is why the `category` is the same, it avoids multiple initializations.
